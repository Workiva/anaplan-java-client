## DOCUMENTATION

The Anaplan Java Client documentation consists of:

1. "Anaplan API Guide", which shows the workflow of making a series of API calls for import, export, delete, and process. See https://community.anaplan.com/anapedia/integrations/data-integration/anaplan-api-guide

2. For those who already understand the workflow, the API Reference at "Anaplan REST API for Integration" at https://anaplanbulkapi20.docs.apiary.io

# Developers

## SDK

The SDK provides the `Service` class, representing a connection to the Anaplan Connect server, along with associated classes representing accessible resources on the server.
Software using this library should conform to the following pattern:

- A new Service object is instantiated for the service endpoint.
- The Service has many necessary properties set. In particular, service credentials need to be provided.
- The Service object can be used to access Workspace objects, from which Model objects can be accessed, and so on. These are all tied to that Service object.
- When all interaction has been completed, the Service.close() method should be called to release any resources.

The SDK also provides:

- A mechanism to use custom [Transport-providers](src/main/java/com/anaplan/client/transport/README.md) (default: ApacheHttpProvider) for custom API communication.
- A mechanism to use custom [Serialization handlers](src/main/java/com/anaplan/client/serialization/README.md), to help serialize the data to and from Anaplan.
